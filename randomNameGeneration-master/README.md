# randomNameGeneration
a name generating program using Probablity<br>
> use the website the readme isn't working<br>
### This is a very basic name generation software<br>
and I emphasize on the point this WILL give you perfect words as elric,linus,alberto,danial or even senpai,but you need to give it a lot 
of data for that and the last time i tried it with only 10 words it generated the name,"govinabh" and only god knows where it came from
(haha I know[sorry i needed data]) so please keep it in mind that this is a very very primitive try at Cognitive computing and the 
improvements to this algorithm are insane i mean conditional on conditional prob and what not<br>
## ver -> 0B(10) <br>
now the thing is I could have commited before this but my playfull side is like "oye normal sane argon why not give them a little 
something called suspense" so I did not commit and due to a "Series of unfortunate events" lost all the good code so yep I need to cut to 
the chase{the whole thing is commented in the code}
<br><br>
### new features :-<br>
- it reads from a textFile with a lot of data plus it discards integers unlike last time so you can add like truckloads of data<br>
- it does not display stats for nerds (sorry nerds it was too disturbing)<br>
- AAANNNDD i forgot to add a while loop yet again

## ver ->0B(01)<br>
#### {learned a lot of new java syntax today lemme use it OWO}
> I tried to write neat code this time, hope u liked it :)
<br>
## How to use
It is quite simple you open it type some names and * poof * (before poof you have to type //quit) a name will be generated and the important thing is that the more data u put the more unique and better names will be generated unlike asanaoba or govinabh or amamamit or areelopa<br>
###  DrawBacks:-<br>
-  it will only generate 1 name (i was too lazy to use a loop)<br>
-  it has a trashy terminal UI<br>
-  it displays stats for nerds<br>

##### GOOD LUCK
